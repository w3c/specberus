# What

Specberus (ˈspɛk bər əs) *n. new* pubrules *automatic checker and documentation tool.*

*Specberus* is expected to replace the [current pubrules tool](http://www.w3.org/2005/07/pubrules) in the near future.

---

# Why

[`http://www.w3.org/2005/07/pubrules`](http://www.w3.org/2005/07/pubrules) has been around for nine years. While it has served us well, there is room for improvement:

--

* Complex maintenance.
* XSLT is not flexible enough.
* There is no clear separation beetween the documentation (*human-readable publication rules*) and the automatic checker (*the software*).
* Difficult to integrate within the broader publication workflow.

---

# How

In JavaScript, on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/); with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/).

The tests are all written in `test/all-rules.js` and fixtures are available in `test/docs`.

# How: automated builds

Using [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/).

    $ mocha

---

# How: dependencies

`# apt-get install`:
* [`nodejs`](http://nodejs.org/)
* [`npm`](http://github.com/isaacs/npm)

--

`$ npm install`
(but you can do `npm install -d` instead to install all at once):
* [`express`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/express) (web framework)
* [`express-rest`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/express-rest) (REST server framework)
* [`socket.io`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/socket.io) (realtime application server and client)
* [`safe-url-input-checker`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/safe-url-input-checker) (URL checker)
* [`superagent`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/superagent) (HTTP request library)
* [`whacko`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/whacko) (HTML parser)

---

# How: dependencies for debugging

Necessary for development, testing and debugging:
* [`mocha`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mocha) (JavaScript test framework)
* [`expect.js`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/expect.js) (assertion library)

--

Nice to have for debugging:
* [`node-debug`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/debug)

# How Specberus has improved recently

`0.3.3` → `0.4.0`

* Recursive validation of compound documents.
* Better heuristics to detect and check dates, WG's, etc.
* Better output, more detailed feedback to the user:
  * Colour-coding error/warning messages.
  * Informative messages can be displayed, too.
  * Ability to include markup in the output, eg hyperlinks.
* Added a *summary of results*, with internal links.
* Implemented a few new rules.
* Some enhancements related to usability and design.
* Extended the suite of tests (there are 63 individual tests now).
* Bug-fixing.
* Deployed on a dedicated *Node.js* server.
* Exposing a REST API to enable integration within the broader publication workflow [WIP].

---

# When: pending tasks

`0.5.0`?  
`1.0.0`?

1. *[Offer help descriptions for all rules and all errors](https://github.com/w3c/specberus/issues/22)* and *[Reproduce documentation from pubrules](https://github.com/w3c/specberus/issues/25)* (related).
2. *[Write command-line client](https://github.com/w3c/specberus/issues/5)*
3. *[Expose as HTTP API](https://github.com/w3c/specberus/issues/4)*
4. *[The hierarchy of available profiles is hard-coded in the UI](https://github.com/w3c/specberus/issues/51)*
5. *[Track whacko for better support for next/nextAll/prev/prevAll so that we can remove lots of nasty hacks](https://github.com/w3c/specberus/issues/3)*
6. *[Make rule checking more parallelised, notably for network IO](https://github.com/w3c/specberus/issues/1)*
7. Improve performance.
8. Polish design and test on more platforms.
