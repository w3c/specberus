/**
 * Test HTML and CSS checkers.
 *
 * This file is not runnable by Mocha directly; it is used by "rules.js".
 *
 * HTML and CSS validations often time out, and Travis CI thinks the build is broken when it happens.
 * Therefore, we only add these test cases when testing locally.
 * See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/specberus/issues/164">w3c/specberus#164</a> and
 * <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Environment-variables">Travis documentation</a>.
